## Tracks & Challenge
### Track 1: Seal Detection
Seals may overlap with Kuzushiji characters (or other seals) and appear with faint ink, adversely affecting detection accuracy. 

You can download our dataset for Track 1: Seal Detection [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/EhOn3QlrciNLtCXkdwY2y5oBbcjT6zlbpUaA7Xuj-DkFfg?e=N3dXWE).

### Track 2: Document Binarization
When seals overlap with Kuzushiji characters, removing the seals while preserving (or even restoring) the underlying characters poses a significant challenge.

### Pretrained Models
You can download our pretrained models [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/Er-w8GewvF1OhD1NK-3zqD4BhF15-o4Bc9txTcz-IetBBA?e=RkJFgK).

### Train & Val & Test
We conducted training, validation, and testing of YOLO models using the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) YOLO framework.
For instance, the YOLOv8m model was trained and evaluated using the following instructions:
```
  yolo detect train model=yolov8m.pt data=./meta.yaml epochs=100 batch=16 imgsz=640 device=0,1 workers=8 optimizer=SGD lr0=0.01 name=train_yolov8m
  yolo val model=./runs/detect/train_yolov8m/weights/best.pt data=./meta.yaml split=test imgsz=640 batch=16 conf=0.25 iou=0.6 device=0,1 workers=8 name=test_yolov8m
```
